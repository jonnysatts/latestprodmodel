# Marketing Analytics Enhancements

## Overview

This document outlines proposed enhancements to the Marketing Analytics page to make it more useful for scenario planning, particularly for event-based businesses. The current implementation relies on default assumptions rather than configurable inputs, limiting its value for real-world decision making.

## Current Limitations

The current Marketing Analytics tab has several limitations:

1. **Reliance on Default Values**: Metrics like LTV use hardcoded values rather than user inputs
2. **Disconnected from Business Model**: Not tailored for event-based businesses
3. **Limited Scenario Planning**: No way to test "what-if" scenarios
4. **Poor Data Integration**: Minimal integration with actual performance data

## Proposed Enhancements

### 1. Configurable Marketing Analytics Inputs

Add configurable inputs grouped into the following categories:

#### Acquisition Metrics
- **Marketing Channel Mix (%)**: Allocation of budget across different channels
- **Cost Per Impression**: By channel (social, search, display, etc.)
- **Awareness to Interest Rate (%)**: What percentage of people who see your marketing become interested
- **Initial Engagement Rate (%)**: Click-through or initial interaction rate

#### Event-Specific Conversion Metrics
- **Interest to Registration Rate (%)**: Percentage of interested people who register/RSVP
- **Registration to Attendance Rate (%)**: Show-up rate for registered attendees
- **Average Group Size**: How many people typically attend together

#### Value Metrics
- **Ticket Upsell Rate (%)**: Percentage who upgrade to premium tickets
- **On-site Spending**: Average additional spend at the event
- **Merchandise Purchase Rate (%)**: Percentage who buy merchandise

#### Retention Metrics
- **Return Visit Rate (%)**: Percentage who attend another event within X months
- **Social Amplification Factor**: Number of people reached through attendee sharing
- **Word-of-Mouth Referrals**: Average number of new attendees referred by each attendee

#### Business Impact
- **CAC Recovery Period**: How many events/purchases needed to recover acquisition cost
- **Marketing Efficiency Ratio**: Revenue generated per marketing dollar
- **Brand Lift Estimate (%)**: Estimated increase in brand recognition from events

### 2. Scenario Planning Interface

- Create a scenario comparison view
- Allow saving multiple scenarios for comparison
- Implement a sensitivity analysis tool to identify high-impact variables
- Provide best/worst/likely case templates

### 3. Visualization Improvements

- Add funnel visualization showing conversion stages
- Implement trend charts showing how metrics change over time
- Create comparative charts for channel performance
- Add year-over-year comparison for repeat events

### 4. Integration with Actual Data

- Use actual performance data to suggest realistic ranges for inputs
- Compare forecasted vs. actual performance
- Allow importing of performance metrics from Google Analytics, social platforms, etc.
- Implement a unified marketing attribution model

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Input Framework
- Create the data model for configurable inputs
- Implement basic input form UI with defaults
- Update calculation functions to use inputs
- Add save/load configuration functionality

### Phase 2: Scenario Planning
- Implement scenario saving/comparison
- Create sensitivity analysis tools
- Build best/worst/likely case templates
- Add tagging and organization features

### Phase 3: Advanced Visualizations
- Develop enhanced visualization components
- Implement interactive charts
- Create shareable reports
- Add PDF export functionality

### Phase 4: Data Integration
- Build Google Analytics integration
- Add social media platform connectors
- Implement unified attribution modeling
- Create data import/export tools

## Technical Considerations

### Data Model Extensions
```typescript
interface MarketingScenario {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  
  // Acquisition metrics
  channelMix: ChannelAllocation[];
  awarenessToInterestRate: number;
  initialEngagementRate: number;
  
  // Event conversion metrics
  interestToRegistrationRate: number;
  registrationToAttendanceRate: number;
  averageGroupSize: number;
  
  // Value metrics
  ticketUpsellRate: number;
  onSiteSpending: number;
  merchandisePurchaseRate: number;
  
  // Retention metrics
  returnVisitRate: number;
  socialAmplificationFactor: number;
  wordOfMouthReferrals: number;
  
  // Business impact
  cacRecoveryPeriod: number;
  marketingEfficiencyRatio: number;
  brandLiftEstimate: number;
}

interface ChannelAllocation {
  channelId: string;
  allocation: number;
  costPerImpression: number;
  expectedImpressions: number;
  conversionRate: number;
}
```

### UI Component Requirements
- Form inputs with validation
- Range sliders with min/max constraints
- Preset templates for common scenarios
- Comparison tables and differential highlighting
- Interactive sensitivity analysis tools

## Benefits

Implementing these enhancements will:

1. Provide more actionable insights for marketing decisions
2. Allow for better budget allocation across channels
3. Help identify high-impact areas for optimization
4. Create a feedback loop between planning and performance
5. Make the tool more valuable for event-based businesses
6. Support data-driven decision making

## Next Steps

1. Review and prioritize proposed enhancements
2. Create detailed technical specifications
3. Develop UI mockups for the enhanced interfaces
4. Implement a phased rollout plan
5. Consider integration with other analytics platforms
